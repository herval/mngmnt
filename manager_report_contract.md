# ðŸ‘‡Manager:Report contract

## Make sure everything finishes, give feedback and keep them unblocked.

- Itâ€™s OK TO MESS UP. Explicitly let them know this, and act accordingly.
- Itâ€™s ok for you to suggest technical changes, but be clear on why and try to do it only to 1) prevent tech debt/accidental complexity or 2) address use cases the team is not seeing
- Make the contract clear
    - Make the career ladder clear. Make the job expectations clear.
    - Don't assume /anyone/ knows even the basics, like career progression.

## Coach for results & quality

- If someone is underperforming, BE CLEAR TO THEM.
- If someone is over-performing, be clear about the requirements for the next level and help them get there!
- Go hands on, but donâ€™t block progress. If you donâ€™t go hands on, youâ€™ll not be able to verify if things are being done properly. If you take big features, youâ€™ll not have time for your role and/or do incomplete work

## Build the bridges

- Share information with them. As much as possible, as often as possible, even if you donâ€™t know what to do with that information. They may know.
- Be EXEMPLARY. Everyone will do something you do - eg if you do PRs with no context, donâ€™t expect or ask the team to get any better at theirs. If you don't care about uptime, don't expect the team to operate anything with quality.

## Be present but don't micromanage
