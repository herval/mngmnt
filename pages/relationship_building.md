# Relationship building

- One-off meetings lead to transactional behavior
- Build dialogue first, reach out on specific problems later


## Transactional vs Relational behaviors

| Transactional | Relational |
|---------------|------------|
| professional | friendly |
| self-interest | mutual interest | 
| what you get | what you give |
| stay in touch | keep informed |
| understand the process | understand the person in the process |
| judge the results | evaluate the relationship | 
| win conflict | resolve conflict |
| agreement | acceptance |
| evaluate the results | evaluate how the other feels about the results |


## Game Theory

- Build trust by _repeat interactions_, _actively seeking win-wins together_ and _communicate enough_.
- Game Theory models everyone as "players". Copycats & Always-cooperative players lead to better outcomes. Environments dominated by Always-cheat players dwindle.
