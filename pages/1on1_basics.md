# 1:1 Basics

# Radical Candor's basics
- Have _regular_ 1:1s
- Be on time
- Change the setting (walks, meeting rooms, etc)
- Make the agenda 80% theirs. _Listen a lot_.
- _Have a shared doc_.

## Areas to focus on 1:1s
- Results - blockers, progress towards goals. _Avoid turning it into a status check meeting_.
- Career Development - what should I focus on next? Focus on the long term.
- Feedback - collect feedback about others and from the report's day-to-day

# Do not use 1:1s as a status check
Let reports set the agenda. Some ice-breakers:
- What do they want to be doing? 
- What are they not doing? 
- What do they feel like they ought to be doing?


# First 1:1 checklist - Lara Hogan's method
This list helps setting context and figure out how to better interact with a new report. _Only ask if you intend to follow through_.

### Grumpiness

- What makes you grumpy?
- How will I know when you’re grumpy?
- How can I help you when you’re grumpy?


### Feedback & Recognition

- How do you like feedback - the medium (IRC, email, in person, etc.)
- How do you like feedback - routine like in 1:1s, or as-it-happens
- How do you prefer to receive recognition? (public or private)


### Goals and Support

- What makes 1:1s the most valuable for you?
- What are your goals for this year? And for the next 3 months?
- What do you need from your manager?
- From your team? (this one is good if the 1:1 is with someone who manages people, but is typically relevant for IC’s, too)
- From your peers? (outside the team)
- Human learning and growth requires the right amount of four things: new challenges, low ego, space to reflect and brainstorm, and timely and clear feedback. How are these four going for you? Is there one you need more or less of?
- What’s your favorite baked good?


## General 1:1 tips

- Ask open ended questions (how/what/why)
- Don’t interject
- Don’t relate (“I have a similar story”)
- Listen, don’t wait to reply
- Let reports speak
- Silence is good. Get over the discomfort and _listen_.
