# Giving personal feedback

![](../imgs/situational_feedback.png)


## Be situational, specific and timely

- Criticism: be clear, show why it's bad, ask how to get back on track
- Address the event/situation, not the person ("the project failed", not "you are a failure")
- Present evidence, not conclusions
- Avoid judging
- Make expectations clear
- Be constant and close to the facts

## Be clear and show you care

Clear and specific feedback is _always_ better, even if it's bad.
