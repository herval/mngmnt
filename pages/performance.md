# Performance & high output

## The High Output Management framework

### Everything is process
Everything can be modeled as a repeatable production process. 
Understanding the inputs, outputs, timing, limiting steps, quality controls and variability lets us create and improve the system needed to fulfill our goals

### Focus on vital, measurable indicators of output
Organization are "black boxes", you can’t see everything on a daily basis. 
*Indicators* let you view on what the output of the organization might be in future. 

Ask teams to _select a small number of objective, quantifiable measures of output, with leading and trending indicators_, that can be reviewed frequently.

💭 the notion of _output as the important thing to measure_ is not always beneficial. Focusing on _outcomes_ may lead to better culture.

### Managerial leverage dramatically impacts organizational output
Managers create leverage through three activities: 
1) information gathering 
2) decision making
3) “nudging” others

Doing it right:
- Delegation with supervision
- Training and influencing processes with unique skills or knowledge

Doing it wrong:
- Delaying decisions
- Meddling
- Abdication
- Unnecessary interruption.

💭 many studies suggest managers should _not_ focus on decision making, but rather on _decision synthesis_ ("managers as editors").

### Meetings
Meetings are a medium of work, both too few and too many meetings create waste.

#### Process-oriented meetings
##### One-on-one
- One manager and one staff member
- Exchange information
- Discuss “thorny” issues
- Uncover problems
- Review important but not urgent items

##### Staff meetings
- Manager and team for structured free discussion
- Sharing of different points of view
- Decision making

Manager role: leader, observer, expediter, questioner and decision-maker
Doing it wrong (things to *avoid*): 
- Lecturing
- Weighing in too soon or too heavily to bias decisions that should be owned by the team

##### Operational reviews
- One organization presents to others to share information and receive questions and feedback
- _Very expensive_
- Managers role: keep the meetings on-track

#### Mission-oriented meetings
- Created ad-hoc to reach a decision. 
- Should be rare (less than 25% of your time). 
- Meeting chair should ensure the people vital to reaching a decision attend and are prepared.

💭 Alternatively known as: "Big Decision Meetings"

### Decisions are the output of a process framed by six questions
- What decision is needed? 
- By when?
- Who should be consulted? 
- Who decides? 
- Who ratifies or vetoes? 
- Who needs to be informed?

Doing it right: 
- Decisions should be made at _the lowest competent level_ by someone with both _detailed technical understanding and past experiences_, both good and bad, from different implementation approaches. 
- When no one has both, create a composite opinion from the people available.
- Consensus is NOT a goal on itself. Support for the output is, even with disagreement.

### Manage short-term objectives based on long-term plans
Long term plans require you to:
- Size your market
- Know where you are
- Find a hypothetical path to meet demand

Doing it right:
- Map progress with Short-term Objectives (sub-goals) and Key Results
- Goals must be *clear, unambiguous milestones to pace progress*. 
- Cascade "OKRs" across organizations

Eg.: A manager’s objective can be “keep a factory expansion plan on schedule” with one key result being “obtain plant expansion decision by October”, she might delegate that key result to a staff member as an objective, and so on. [OKRs](okrs.md) provide clarity and alignment, but they can’t be run on auto-pilot. It takes judgment and common sense to guide day-to-day priorities based on OKR hierarchies.

As organizations grow, speed decreases while leverage increases. Businesses become more complex as they grow. Duplication and redundancy increase — multiple products may lead to multiple marketing teams, for example — and decisions are constantly being made on whether to centralize functions for consistency and greater leverage or to keep them decentralized for greater speed.

Functional teams increase leverage, mission-oriented teams increase speed. Functional organizations (e.g. “Recruiting”, “Finance”, “Human Resources”) offer leverage by centralizing services to deliver benefits to an entire enterprise, rather than a subset. The trade-off is increased complexity and delay in managing requests from business units. In contrast, mission-oriented organizations (e.g. “Component Business Group”, “Systems Business Group”) are decentralized and pursue objectives largely independent of other parts of the enterprise, trading-off leverage for speed (closer proximity to customers and faster time to react). Speed is the only benefit to mission-oriented organizations, in all other cases functional organizations are superior. The exception is conglomerates, when high diversity in business goals makes functional teams impractical.

### Dual reporting increases leverage and speed

"Matrix management" - individuals have functional & mission-oriented managers

Dual reporting increases both leverage and speed. Invented at NASA as “matrix management” individuals in dual reporting structures have managers in both mission-oriented and functional teams (e.g. A financial controller reports to both the Division Manager and the Director of Finance). 
While this solution creates complexity, the cost of complexity is outweighed by the benefits of operating in both functional and mission-oriented teams.

### Manage teams by setting expectations and cultural values. 

When Complexity, Uncertainty and Ambiguity (“CUA”), is low, a team’s performance is influenced by expectations (via role definitions, setting objectives, checking-in and reviewing performance). 
When CUA is high, behavior is influenced by cultural values (as articulated and exemplified by the manager). Managers need to choose which mode to use depending on context.
This model assumes individuals share group interests, if individuals are too highly self-interested their behavior will be influenced very differently. In low CUA situations they’ll behave based on incentives (a.k.a “free market forces”, like commission rewards for selling certain products). In high CUA situations individuals with high self-interest and low group-interest will be unmanageable, like people panicking on a sinking ship. People’s mix of self-interest and group-interest can shift over time. It’s a manager’s responsibility to align team members to group interests.

### Motivate employees by “shaping the field” based on what drives them
Increasing motivation and training are the only ways a manager can increase individual performance. To increase motivation, understand an individual’s highest 
level needs, whether it’s increasing competence or achievement, and preferred measure, whether compared to others or objective benchmarks. Then, like a coach motivating athletes, “shape the field” to create the motivation to grow team members to the limit of their abilities.

### Manage in the context of task-relevant maturity
When you’re managing a skilled sales person with high task-relevant maturity your involvement should be minimal, focused only on setting and monitoring high-level objectives. 
Transfer that same person into a plant management role, where they’ll initially have low task-relevant maturity, and you’re more effective with a lower-level, task-oriented management style, focused on “what”, “when”, and “how” of operations. 
Getting this right is difficult because it’s hard for managers to assess task-relevant maturity and it’s hard to override personal preferences in management style.

### Use performance reviews to improve performance
There are many motivations, emotions and mistakes associated with performance reviews, but improving performance — by providing clear task-relevant feedback and intensifying motivation 
— is paramount. Developing an effective assessment and message for an employee requires both including what’s important and leaving out what is not important.
(Whether you’re writing your first performance review, or your hundredth, I highly recommend reading this chapter carefully for its detail and examples.)

### When an employee quits, it’s the manager’s fault
This doesn’t include people leaving for money or perks, but when someone is dedicated and loyal and feels their work is unappreciated it is the failure of the manager when they decide to leave. Most often employees bring up leaving at an inconvenient, highly busy time. Regardless, it should be high priority for a manager to make sure the employee feels heard and valued, to address their issues and retain them or transfer them to another team within the enterprise that meets their needs.

### Recycle high achievers who are over-promoted
As achievers are promoted they typically cycle between “exceeds expectations” at their current level and “meets expectations” in their first review after taking on greater responsibility.
Management should be careful not to promote someone too quickly and having them “below expectations” at the higher level for too long. It’s an embarrassing situation for management and the employee. However, instead of ejecting them from the company for low-performance, as is common, it’s more useful to recycle the employee into a more appropriate role, despite the complexity, emotions and awkwardness that may be caused.

### Training is the manager’s jo
Training is the highest leverage activity a manager can do to increase the output of an organization. If a manager spends 12 hours preparing training for 10 team members that increases their output by 1% on average, the result is 200 hours of increased output from the 10 employees (each works about 2000 hours a year). Don’t leave training to outsiders, do it yourself.

### Assess your own output
The final chapter offers a set of “homework” assignments to apply the ideas in the book. Andy sets the expectation that if you complete at least 100 points of the total possible 320 points offered in the assignments, you’ll be a better manager. No better way to end a book about managing output than measuring the output of the book itself on the reader.
