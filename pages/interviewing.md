## Topgrading

Top-grading is an interview method focused on evaluating a candidate's entire career history in a short period of time. The interview structure revolves around the same set of questions, covering mainly the candidate's major successes and failures, how they work as part of a team and their self-awareness around areas of improvement from the point of view of others, during various stages of their careers.
Interview structure
The process itself is simple: ask the candidate the same questions, in reverse chronological order, for each of their previous roles. It's important to ask all questions for each role. For roles where candidates stayed for a very short period of time (1-3 months), it's ok to skip the "successes and failures" part.

Step 1: explain the process to the candidate
This is a reasonable "opener", to get the candidate on the right mindset:

Hi X! The purpose of this interview is to get to talk a bit about your past experiences, so we can get a sense of how you work. There's no right or wrong answers, I'm looking for an honest self-assessment. I'll ask for names of previous managers/bosses or tech leads, for reference - we will not get in touch with any of them without requesting your authorization first. For the interest of time, we'll not get into technical details on what you worked on each role.

Step 2: for each role (that applies for big role changes on the same company too), ask:
When did you start at X?
What were you hired to do?
What were your biggest success and biggest failure on that role?
Who was your direct manager/boss? (ask for a name - reassure you're not reaching out without their authorization, if they get uncomfortable)
What would Y say were your biggest strength and biggest area of improvement?
What would you say were your direct manager/boss' biggest strength and area of improvement?
What was your team dynamic like?
Why did you leave X?

 And that's about it! You can close the interview with questions about what the candidate is looking to do next, leave time for questions, etc - the evaluation can be done based solely on the data collected on step 2. For candidates with no clear career background, you can focus your evaluation on their academic experience, freelance gigs (replacing "manager" with "client"), etc.
Theoretical background
This interview is intentionally structured to remove biases around self-selection ("tell me about a time when you..."), made-up/exaggerated stories (by asking for actual manager's names - aka the TORC Technique) or too much focus on the what (getting into too much detail on what was done, but ignoring how the candidate works). As such, this is an efficient method of cultural and technical fit, and presents a much lower "mishire ratios" than non-structured conversations.

It also helps us gauge core values objectively, without asking the candidate for specific values, by making their values self-evident based on their past behavior, as opposed to a self-provided description ("tell me about a time you were entrepreneurial").
