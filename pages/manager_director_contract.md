# 👆Manager:Director contract

## Basic expectations

- If you promise X, deliver X. If you deliver X+1, GREAT, but aim to overdeliver if you can, not overpromise
    - Slips and surprises are fine, but if you’re paying attention, they shouldn’t happen very frequently.
    - Overdeliver is NOT “cook a surprise without telling anyone”. 
        - You WILL waste everyone’s time cooking up surprises. Get feedback early and often. You are NOT here to surprise your peers, same way an engineer shouldn't quietly refactor everyone's code on a sunday night
    - If you overstuff your team’s sprints, they’ll burn out and tech debt will multiply. 
        - Ideally aim to close ALL tickets on a sprint as a baseline, then bring in tech debt or bug bashes or anything when all commitments are met
    - “I’m blocked because of X’s roadmap” - talk to each other and unblock. 
        - Escalate if in a deadlock.
    - Let the team make decisions. Let the team propose projects. Let the team talk to people directly. 
        - Let the team do the work and push for quality!

- The other managers are your team
    - Good Analogy: you and your peer managers are building cars, but specialized in different aspects. Paint is not less important than the engine. If you don’t talk, the engine won’t fit the chassis.
    - Good analogy: school teachers. You’re all here to make well round students graduate and do excellent homework. Math is not less important than geography.
    - Bad analogy: you are a sports coach of a full team. You’re not competing with other teams, every time you do, you make your own life harder.
    
- Your team members are both the people you serve and the "resources" for execution. 
    - They are _not_ peers or buddies! Approaching reports as friends will prevent you from doing objective evaluations and will dampen their growth.
