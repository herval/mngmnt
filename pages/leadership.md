## Kinds of Leaders

Buddhist tradition describes three styles of compassionate leadership 
- The _trailblazer_, who leads from the front, takes risks, and sets an example
- The _ferryman_, who accompanies those in his care and shapes the ups and downs of the crossing
- The _shepherd_, who sees every one of his flock into safety before himself. 

Three styles, three approaches, but what they have in common is an all-encompassing concern for the welfare of those they lead.
