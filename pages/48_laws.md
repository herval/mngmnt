# The 48 Laws of Power

☢️ This summary is in no way an endorsement of acknowledgement of effectiveness of any of these techniques. 
In fact, I _violently disagree_ with the majority of these laws, and they are clear indicators of individuals you want to _avoid_ in a professional setting. 
Fact is, you _will_ encounter many people that follow this kind of advice, so it's always good to be prepared ☢

> If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. 
>
> -- Sun Tzu


## Never outshine the master
- Make your masters appear more brilliant than they are and you will attain the heights of power
- Outshining the master is perhaps the worst mistake of all
- Never take your position for granted and never let any favors you receive go to your head

## Never put too much trust in friends, learn how to use enemies
- Hire a former enemy and he will be more loyal than a friend, because he has more to prove
- You have more to fear from friends than from enemies
- If you have no enemies, find a way to make them
- Honesty rarely strengthens friendship, you may never know how a friend truly feels
- Friends will say that they love your poetry — maybe they mean it, often they do not
- Judge who is best able to further your interests in all situations. Keep friends for friendship, but work with the skilled and competent

## Conceal Your Intentions
- Use decoyed objects and desires and red herrings to throw people off the scent
- Hide your intentions not by closing up (with the risk of appearing secretive, and making people suspicious) but by talking endlessly about your desires and goals — just not your real ones
- Appear friendly, open, and trusting; conceal your intentions; send your rivals on time-consuming wild-goose chases
- Use smoke screens to disguise your actions. By the time they realize your intentions, it will be too late

## Always say less than necessary
- Persons who cannot control his words shows that he cannot control himself, and is unworthy of respect 
- Power cannot accrue to those who squander their treasure of words
- Power is in many ways a game of appearances, and when you say less than necessary, you appear greater and more powerful than you are
- Once the words are out, you cannot take them back. Keep them under control
- Be particularly careful with sarcasm: The momentary satisfaction you gain with your biting words will be outweighed by the price you pay

## So much depends on reputation, guard it with your life
- Always be alert to potential attacks and thwart them before they happen
- Learn to destroy your enemies by opening holes in their own reputations, then stand aside and let public opinion hang them
- Doubt is a powerful weapon: Once you let it out of the bag with insidious rumors, your opponents are in a horrible dilemma
- Once you have a solid base of respect, ridiculing your opponent both puts him on the defensive and draws more attention to you, enhancing your own reputation

## Court attention at all costs
- Surround your name with the sensational and the scandalous
- Better to be slandered and attacked than ignored
- Make yourself a magnet of attention by appearing larger, more colorful, more mysterious, than the bland and timid masses
- Create an air of mystery

## Get others to do the work for you, but always take the credit
- Use the wisdom, knowledge, and legwork of other people to further your own cause
- It will give you a godlike aura of efficiency and speed 
- In the end your helpers will be forgotten and you will be remembered 
- Never do yourself what others can do for you

## Make other people come to you, use bait if necessary
- For negotiations or meetings, it is always wise to lure others into your territory, or the territory of your choice
- You have your bearings, while they see nothing familiar and are subtly placed on the defensive

## Win through your actions, never through argument
- Triumph gained through argument is really a Pyrrhic victory: The resentment and ill will you stir up and last long
- Get others to agree with you through your actions, without saying a word
- Demonstrate, do not explicate

## Infection: Avoid the unhappy or the unlucky
- You can die from someone else’s misery – emotional states are as infectious as disease
- You may feel you are helping the drowning man but you are only precipitating your own disaster
- The unfortunate sometimes draw misfortune on themselves; they will also draw it on you
- Associate with the happy and fortunate instead

## Learn to keep people dependent on you
- To maintain your independence you must always be needed and wanted
- The more you are relied on, the more freedom you have
- Make people depend on you for their happiness and prosperity and you have nothing to fear
- Never teach them enough so that they can do without you

## Use selective honesty and generosity to disarm your victim
- One sincere and honest move will cover over dozens of dishonest ones
- Open-hearted gestures of honesty and generosity bring down the guard of even the most suspicious people
- Once your selective honesty opens a hole in their armor, you can deceive and manipulate them at will
- A timely gift – a Trojan horse – will serve the same purpose

## When asking for help, appeal to people’s self interest, never their mercy or gratitude
- If you need to turn to an ally for help, uncover something in your request, or in your alliance with him, that will benefit him, and emphasize it out of all proportion
- He will respond enthusiastically when he sees something to be gained for himself

## Pose as a friend, work as a spy
- Knowing about your rival is critical
- Use spies to gather valuable information that will keep you a step ahead
- In polite social encounters, learn to probe. Ask indirect questions to get people to reveal their weaknesses and intentions. 
- There is no occasion that is not an opportunity for artful spying.

## Crush your enemy totally
- Feared enemy must be crushed completely
- If one ember is left alight, no matter how dimly it smolders, a fire will eventually break out
- More is lost through stopping halfway than through total annihilation

## Use absence to increase strength and honor
- The more you are seen and heard from, the more common you appear
- If you are already established in a group, temporary withdrawal from it will make you more talked about, even more admired
- You must learn when to leave
- Create value through scarcity
- If you absent yourself too early, you may be forgotten

## Keep others in suspended terror, cultivate an air of unpredictability
- Too much unpredictability will be seen as a sign of indecisiveness
- Patterns are powerful, and you can terrify people by disrupting them
- Behavior that seems to have no consistency or purpose will keep them off balance, and they will wear themselves out trying to explain your moves
- Taken to an extreme, this strategy can intimidate and terrorize

## Do not build a fortress to protect yourself, isolation is dangerous
- Everyone has to protect themselves, but isolation exposes you to more dangers than it protects you from – it cuts you off from information and makes you conspicuous and an easy target
- Circulate among people find allies, mingle
- You are shielded from your enemies by the crowd

## Know who you’re dealing with, do not offend the wrong person
- There are many different kinds of people in the world, and you can never assume that everyone will react to your strategies in the same way
- Deceive or outmaneuver some people and they will spend the rest of their lives seeking revenge
- Choose your victims and opponents carefully, then – never offend or deceive the wrong person

## Do not commit to anyone
- Do not commit to anyone, but be courted by all
- When you hold yourself back, you incur not anger but a kind of respect. You instantly seem powerful because you make yourself ungraspable, rather than succumbing to the group, as most people do
- People who rush to the support of others tend to gain little respect in the process, for their help is so easily obtained
- Do not commit to anyone, stay above the fray
- You have only so much energy and so much time. Every moment wasted on the affairs of others subtracts from your strength.

## Play a sucker to catch a sucker, seem dumber than your mark
- No one likes feeling stupider than the next persons 
- Make your victims feel smart – and not just smart, but smarter than you are

## Use the surrender tactic: transform weakness into power
- People trying to make a show of their authority are easily deceived by the surrender tactic
- It is always our first instinct to react, to meet aggression with some other kind of aggression
- Next time someone pushes you and you find yourself starting to react, try this: Do not resist or fight back, but yield, turn the other cheek, bend
- If you surrender, you have an opportunity to coil around your enemy and strike with your fangs from close up

## Concentrate your forces
- Conserve your forces and energies by keeping them concentrated at their strongest point
- You gain more by finding a rich mine and mining it deeper, than by flitting from one shallow mine to another 
– Intensity defeats extensity every time 
- When looking for sources of power to elevate you, find the one key patron, the fat cow who will give you milk for a long time to come

## Play the perfect courtier
- The perfect courtier thrives in a world where everything revolves around power and political dexterity 
- Master the art of indirection
- Yields to superiors
- Assert power over others in the most oblique and graceful manner

## Re-Create Yourself
- Be the master of your own image rather than letting others define it for you
- The world wants to assign you a role in life, once you accept that role you are doomed
- Remake yourself into a character of power. Working on yourself should be one of your greatest and most pleasurable life tasks
- The first step in the process of self-creation is self-consciousness — be aware of yourself as an actor and taking control of your appearance and emotions
- Create a memorable character, one that compels attention, that stands out above the other players on the stage

## Keep your hands clean
- Conceal your mistakes, have a scapegoat around to blame
- You must seem a paragon of civility and efficiency: your hands are never soiled by mistakes and nasty deeds
- Use others as scapegoats and cat’s-paws to disguise your involvement

## Play on people’s need to believe to create a cult like following
- People have an overwhelming desire to believe in something. Become the focal point of such desire by offering them a cause, a new faith to follow. 
- Keep your words vague but full of promise
- Emphasize enthusiasm over rationality and clear thinking
- Give your new disciples rituals to perform, ask them to make sacrifices on your behalf
- In the absence of organized religion and grand causes, your new belief system will bring you untold power

## Enter action with boldness
- The bolder lie the better
- Lions circle the hesitant prey
- Boldness strikes fear, fear creates authority
- Going halfway with half a heart digs a deeper grave
- Hesitation creates gaps, boldness obliterates them
- Audacity separates you from the herd
- When you are as small and obscure as David was, you must find a Goliath to attack 
- The larger the target, the more attention you gain

## Plan all the way to the end
- The ending is everything. Plan all the way to it, taking into account all the possible consequences, obstacles, and twists of fortune that might reverse your hard work and give the glory to others
- By planning to the end you will not be overwhelmed by circumstances and you will know when to stop
- Gently guide fortune and help determine the future by thinking far ahead

## Make your accomplishments seem effortless
- Your actions must seem natural and executed with ease
- All the toil and practice, and also the clever tricks, must be concealed
- When you act, act effortlessly, as if you could do much more
- Avoid the temptation of revealing how hard you work – it only raises questions
- Teach no one your tricks or they will be used against you

## Control the options, get others to play with the cards you deal
- The best deceptions are the ones that seem to give the other person a choice: Your victims feel they are in control, but are actually your puppets
- Give people options that come out in your favor whichever one they choose
- Force them to make choices between the lesser of two evils, both of which serve your purpose
- Give people a sense of how things will fall apart without you, and you offer them a “choice”: I stay away and you suffer the consequences, or I return under circumstances that I dictate
- Propose three or four choices of action for each situation, and present them in such a way that the one he preferred always seemed the best solution compared to the others
- Force the resister, Push them to “choose” what you want them to do by appearing to advocate the opposite
- Alter the playing field

## Play to people’s fantasies
- People rarely believe that their problems arise from their own misdeeds and stupidity
- Someone or something out there is to blame — the other, the world, the gods — and so salvation comes from the outside as well
- Never appeal to truth and reality unless you are prepared for the anger that comes for disenchantment

## Discover each man’s thumbscrew
- Everyone has a weakness 
- That weakness is usually an insecurity, an uncontrollable emotion or need or small secret pleasure 
- Pay attention to gestures and unconscious signals
- Find the helpless child, look to their childhood
- Look for contrasts, an overt trait often reveals its opposite
- Find the weak link
- Fill their emotional void
- Feed on their uncontrollable emotion
- Always look for passions and obsessions that cannot be controlled. What people cannot control, you can control for them.

## Be royal in your own fashion. Act like a king to be treated like one
- The way you carry yourself will often determine how you are treated
- Appearing vulgar or common will make people disrespect you
- A king respects himself and inspires the same sentiment in others
- By acting confident of your powers, you make yourself seem destined to wear a crown

## Master the art of timing
- Never seem to be in a hurry – hurrying betrays a lack of control over yourself, and over time
- Always seem patient, as if you know that everything will come to you eventually
- Become a detective of the right moment; sniff out the spirit of the times, the trends that will carry you to power
- Learn to stand back when the time is not yet ripe, and to strike fiercely when it has reached fruition

## Disdain things you cannot have, ignoring them is the best revenge
- You choose to let things bother you
- By acknowledging a petty problem you give it existence and credibility
- You can just as easily choose not to notice the irritating offender, to consider the matter trivial and unworthy of your interest
- The more you want something, the more you chase after it, the more it eludes you. 
- The more interest you show, the more you repel the object of your desire 
- Uncontrollable desire makes you seem weak, unworthy, pathetic
- The less interest you reveal, the more superior you seem

## Create compelling spectacles
- Striking imagery and grand symbolic gestures create the aura of power
 - Stage spectacles for those around you, then full of arresting visuals and radiant symbols that heighten your presence 
 - Dazzled by appearances, no one will notice what you are really doing

## Think as you like but behave like others
- If you make a show of going against the times, flaunting your unconventional ideas and unorthodox ways, people will think that you only want attention and that you look down upon them
- They will find a way to punish you for making them feel inferior
- Blend in and nurture the common touch
- Share your originality only with tolerant friends and those who are sure to appreciate your uniqueness

## Stir up waters to catch fish
- Anger and emotion are strategically counterproductive
- You must always stay calm and objective
- If you can make your enemies angry while staying calm yourself, you gain a decided advantage

## Despise the free lunch
- What is offered for free is dangerous – it usually involves either a trick or a hidden obligation
- By paying your own way you stay clear of gratitude, guilt, and deceit
- There is no cutting corners with excellence
- Generosity is a sign and a magnet for power

## Avoid stepping into a great man’s shoes
- What happens first always appears better and more original than what comes after
- If you succeed a great man or have a famous parent, you will have to accomplish double their achievements to outshine them
- Establish your own name and identity by changing course
- Slay the overbearing father, disparage his legacy, and gain power by shining in your own way

## Strike the shepherd and the sheep will scatter
- Within any group, trouble can most often be traced to a single source, the unhappy, chronically dissatisfied one who will always stir up dissension and infect the group with his or her ill ease
- Before you know what hit you the dissatisfaction spreads
 - Act before it becomes impossible to disentangle
- Once you recognize who the stirrer is, pointing it out to other people will accomplish a great deal

## Work on the hearts and minds of others
- Coercion creates a reaction that will eventually work against you
- The key to persuasion is softening people up and breaking them down, gently
- Seduce them with a two-pronged approach: Work on their emotions and play on their intellectual weaknesses
- A person you have seduced becomes your loyal pawn

## Disarm and infuriate with the mirror effect
- When you mirror your enemies, doing exactly as they do, they cannot figure out your strategy
- The Mirror Effect mocks and humiliates them, making them overreact
- By holding up a mirror to their psyches, you seduce them with the illusion that you share their values; by holding up a mirror to their actions, you teach them a lesson

## Preach the need to change, but never reform too much at once
- If change is necessary, make it feel like a gentle improvement on the past
- Too much innovation is traumatic, and will lead to revolt
- Even while people understand the need for change, knowing how important it is for institutions and individuals to be occasionally renewed, they are also irritated and upset by changes that affect them personally

## Never appear too perfect
- Envy creates silent enemies
- It is smart to occasionally display defects, and admit to harmless vices, in order to deflect envy and appear more human and approachable
- Do not try to help or do favors for those who envy you; they will think you are condescending to them

## Do not go past the mark you aimed for. In victory, know when to stop
- The moment of victory is often the moment of greatest peril
- In the heat of victory, arrogance and overconfidence can push you past the goal you had aimed for, and by going too far, you make more enemies than you defeat 
- Do not allow success to go to your head
- There is no substitute for strategy and careful planning
- Set a goal, and when you reach it, stop

## Assume formlessness
- By taking a shape, by having a visible plan, you open yourself to attack
- Instead of taking a form for your enemy to grasp, keep yourself adaptable and on the move
- Accept the fact that nothing is certain and no law is fixed 
- The best way to protect yourself is to be as fluid and formless as water; never bet on stability or lasting order. 
- Everything changes
