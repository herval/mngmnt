# Tribe Building

_Techniques & ideas crowdsourced from ~50 startup founders (Slack Startup Founders group, 2016 - no single author)_


## Share stories
Use them to build bonds and strengthen ties between tribe members

## Be the Example
Walk the walk and talk the talk. 
People only follow those who take their own advice and show they mean what they say

## Create a goal
Define something people want to rally around achieving

## Celebrate Accomplishment
Reward tribal milestones or goals reached, whether collective or that of a tribal 
individual, with shared praise and/or a small physical gift of appreciation

## Build the Story of the Tribe. Set the Vision
Define the tribe's journey, goals, interactions, future, and how teamwork will get them 
where they want to go in a story that epitomizes what the tribe is about. 
Weave every person, skill, and resource into the story.

## Lead with Passion
Show them you are there because you want to be not because you have to.

## Introduce Tribe Members to Each Other
Listen, Learn & Introduce people to each other. 
Make connecting people a priority. 
One of the biggest fears in life is rejection. 
If you can help eliminate that fear you are helping somebody.

## Invent rituals
Summer camps do it. 
So does organized religion. 
Great corporations have their own lingo, their own culture. 
How you speak and the totems and daily rituals build connection.

## Listen Carefully
As well as speaking have a strong ear for what the group is saying. 
Trust that the tribe knows what it needs to grow.
          
## Be Authentic
Phoney is as phoney does.
Show how genuine you really are.

## Create exclusivity
Don't invite everyone to the tribe. 
Just leaders or influential people, or those with something tangible to add.

## Empower Members....
Suggest types of activities/projects that would 'advance the tribe' thereby giving the 
tribe members a method to feel empowered and responsible. And, then hold them responsible.

## Educate
Educate your tribe to help them see things in ways they never imagined. 
Use simple concepts to help them understand complicated ones. 
Break things down and explain what is under the hood. 
They'll be forever grateful someone took the time to do this for them.

## Identify the shared values that unite the tribe
When people share a common set of values it can galvanise a tribe to achieve its goals. 
The process of identifying the tribe's values can involve people, reinforce the role of 
the leader and also helps build the tribe's identity.

## Set some ground rules all can buy into
Even outlining what will and won't fly is good. 
For example, Seth didn't want people coming into Triiibes just to promote themselves. 

## Fun and Stimulating
When possible, work to maintain a fun and stimulating tribal environment. 
A happy tribe is a productive tribe. 
Intellectually stimulated tribe members are productive tribe members - problem solvers.

## Give Peoples' Lives Meaning
Have tribal goals that enrich peoples' lives and give them more meaning

## Mentor & Encourage Mentoring
How? By giving feedback and rewarding feedback.

## Require an Ante to Get in
An ante will weed out people who are not serious and encourage people who put in the initial 
time/money/effort to be active and participate.

## Go Somewhere Different - e.g. Surprise the heck out of them!
As one of my mentors likes to say "zig when they expect you to zag". Be Unique. 
How? Through the element of surprise! Surprise them with gratitude, surprise them with projects, surprise them with praise, 
surprise them with them with parties (Virtual or otherwise), surprise them with balloons. You decide, but just surprise them.

## Create a manifesto.
Your tribe already exists... it just hasn't been defined yet.
So create a manifesto. Give voice to the frustrations of your tribe members. 
If you strike the right tone - if they feel you can relate to them - this manifesto will be the viral tool that gets your 
tribe members to raise their hands and say "I am."

## Encourage a Respectful Environment
Whether you're a tribe member or a tribe leader treat leaders and tribe members with respect. 
Tribes filled with respect and respectful people become tighter - more closely bonded.

## Use Carrots, Not Sticks
Leaders of successful tribes don't use sticks, they use carrots. 
Sticks don't motivate people, carrots do. 
Offer cool incentives to tribe members who work hard enough to qualify. 
Make sure the carrots taste good enough to motivate those tribe members sufficiently.

## Make it Easier
Narrow the distance between intention and action. 
In doing so, tribal interaction becomes more fluid and productive. 
As this distance becomes narrower - the potential productivity of the tribe increases.

## Be Timely and Relevant
Adapt, evolve, while learning from lessons learned.

## Ask what members need, then provide it
A quick survey (formal or not) to find out what people need or what they are in the tribe for, and then facilitate getting that need met.

## Be and Encourager
Whether you're a tribe leader or a tribe member - you wield power. 
Use that power to encourage other tribe members.

## Make It Profitable To Be In, Less To Be Out
Only buyers can be affiliates. 
Club members get unlimited access to facilities. 
Insiders get first dibs at buying stock. Join and enjoy 30 days extra - free.

## Don't control the Tribe
The collective intelligence of a group is far greater than that of a controlling leader

## Invent language
Great corporations have their own lingo, so do great sports teams and niche gurus everywhere. 

## Don't tell, show
Telling a tribe won't make it change. 
Showing how and what to do can lead them to change. 
As Ghandi said "Be the change you want to see"

## Have 'particular' experiences together
Activities that become 'rites of passage' that tribe members experience together, 
whether it's cooking, hunting, dancing. 
Tribes have always done this.

## Create a Tribal Book
Create a Tribal book which has the picture and profile for every member of the Tribe.
It's like the yearly book for schools and Universities. 
Anyone who wants to join needs to fill it in.
Anyone who leaves can still be left there with a sign "left the tribe" or something. 
Unless they want their whole profile removed or alternatively moved to the xTribal book.

## Be a Coach - an Enabler
The tribe needs someone to set the initial ethos, and to keep it on a sensible course - without telling it what to do.

## Have a goal that seems too big to achieve
A committed tribe can achieve extraordinary results - if they're inspired to greatness.

## Ask Tough Questions
Asking tribe members and leaders tough (challenging) questions serves three purposes. 
1) Helps solve challenging problems, 
2) Starts deep, important discussions, and 
3) Draws other tribal members into discussions when they might normally lurk. 
Each of these results in greater tribal cohesion.

## Host Virtual Events
Host virtual events so that all members, regardless of geographical location, can participate and interact in an engaging format.

## Identify what will be enforced
What many organizations misunderstand is that their standards and values are not defined by their aspirations but by what they are prepared to enforce.

## Build a Mecca
A place that members can go to be surrounded by specific examples of your realized vision. 
Incorporate ways for them to learn, celebrate, tinker, and add their ideas.

## Have a noticeboard
A central touchpoint where people can get information and congregate

## Have a regular contest - weekly, monthly
Feature/Highlight "winner"

## Survey your Tribe members - Ask for Feedback
What's working/what's not working/Ask them for their input/feedback

## Encourage Tribal Equality
Be conscientious to think of all tribe members in equal terms. 
Each tribe member offers unique value to the tribe. 
When each tribe member feels valued, a healthier, more productive and cohesive tribe will result.

## Tribe Members First
Remember to put the members of the tribe first. 
Don't neglect your tribe members by focusing too much on recruiting new members. 
Tribe members are smart - they know where they stand.

## Communicate and Plan It.
Make a specific plan a year out for communicating. 
Take it personally and seriously. 
Your tribe has a reason to exist. 
Over-communicate it and in your communications aim to touch, arm, enlist and persist.

## Encourage Play
Everyone likes to play, and not just because it's fun. 
Play makes you feel like you're a part of something larger than yourself.

## Club T-Shirts
Everybody wants to be a part of something, T-shirts are a way to express yourself.

## Encourage Accessible Leadership
Great tribal leaders are accessible to tribe members. 
Accessible leaders better understand the tribal environment and specific needs of the tribe. 
Furthermore, tribe members feel more appreciated when they're able to connect directly with their leaders.

## Interview Tribe Members
Interview members of your Tribe. Let others submit questions. Who knows, maybe they'll be interviewed next?

## Don't be afraid to excommunicate members
It strengthens the tribe when you remove negative, disruptive influences - and provides more incentive for existing members to act in good faith.
(Examples: sacking people who don't fit the culture in a workplace, disabling accounts when people abuse rules on forums, etc.)

## Be Firm, Fair, and Consistent
As a leader, enforce the rules of your tribe in a way that benefits everyone. 
Playing favorites will only make your tribe distrust you.

## Start a hero newsletter
Send the core members of the tribe a regular newsletter, with each issue highlighting the achievements of member of the tribe.

## Have a common enemy
From the cold war to global warming, a powerful enemy can be the tie that binds

## Encourage a Collective Mindset
Encourage tribe members to think in terms of the tribe - not just themselves. 
A collective mentality rises above pride of ownership and encourages tribe members to work together for the common good of the tribe and its objectives.

## Create (or encourage) Sub-tribes (Communities)
Everyone has different skills and interests. Provide a place/forum/groups to optimize this uniqueness.

## Encourage a gift culture
Giving is one of our most important rituals. 
When you receive a gift, learn to appreciate the act itself, not the product. 
Then give yourself. 
Don't compare the gift. 
Enjoy the process, enjoy the intensions. 
Great tribes give and receive respectfully.

## Show Appreciation to Non-member Tribe Supporters
Not all resources and talents come from within a tribe. 
A spouse or business associate of a member may contribute something of value. 
Same for non-members in the community who donate product, services, or valuable input. 
Showing appreciation builds bridges outside the tribe, helps recruitment, and encourages tribe members to find similar supporters.

## Classic: Ethical bribe for email address
Find out what they want. 
Give them your best advice for free and spread the word about it. 
In exchange they become your tribe member with their email address.

## Building a good tribe, builds a better tribe
Everyone wants to belong to something bigger than themselves. 
If you build a tribe that becomes popular, it becomes more popular. 
If the tribe is having fun and learning, others wanting the same will join. 
Cialdini calls this 'social proof'.

## Encourage Volunteerism
Let the tribe decide what cause they would like to take up. 
Give them time to volunteer, perhaps a couple of hours a month.

## Talk to neighborhood tribes
Interview other stakeholders and tribal members from different industries, passions and outlooks. 
It's amazing what you'll be able to apply to your own seemingly disparate tribe.

## Honesty
Be someone people can trust, someone people can believe in.

## Give Feedback
Both Positive and Negative

## Invite. Invite. Invite.
Entice more of what you want to see with personal invitations and request, lots of them.

## Bring them shiny new things
Bring new ideas, trends, colours, concepts from other tribes. 
Talk about the new thing in wedding gowns to your business tribe; and the best ways manager thank their employees to you new brides tribe.        
Stimulate ideas and show how they relate. 
Your tribe will follow you everywhere and back again.

## Team up with another Tribe
Teaming up with some other tribes. 
This does not necessarily mean in everything but having some common intersecting interests with other tribes - you offer something and they do.
Sharing is caring:
Team up with Tribe W for IT/computer/web expertise
Team up with Tribe X for Marketing/Branding expertise
Team up with Tribe Y for Medical/Health expertise
Team up with Tribe Z (your competitor/enemy?) for a common CSR interest-Build Peace?

## Lead by sharing power, not monopolizing it
If your tribe has a great idea, approve it, and let them run with it.

## Do something!
The worst thing you can do for your Tribe is nothing. Do something... now, today, tomorrow, next week. Keep doing something!

## Purpose, Passion, and Promotion....
Promote your tribe every day in every way by demonstrating genuine belief in the tribe and giving your time and energy to everyone you meet. 
Do this inside your tribe WITH PASSION and outside your tribe WITH GENEROSITY and three things will happen:
1) You will demonstrate the values and principles of the tribe (recruit quality people).
2) Your tribe will flourish (develop and learn from experience and exposure). 3 - You will grow as a person (increase your personal value and self-worth). How...

## Aggregate tribe information
Become the information portal for a tribe and empower them to brag about their thoughts. 
Get non tribe members to become jealous because they don't belong... yet.

## Ask for referrals
have a referral program, with benefits for existing members who bring in new members

## Create (or encourage) Sub-tribes (Communities)
Everyone has different skills and interests.
Provide a place/forum/groups to optimize this uniqueness.

## Speak softly - but carry a big stick
It is crucial to maintain a high level of discipline and mutual respect within a tribe to stay on target. 
If done skillfully, acceptance and adherance to rules to that effect will create an environment in which most tribe members will feel "at home". 
It is vital for the leader to visibly enforce these rules at all times if he has to.

## Play Big Outside of the Box
Don't be afraid of abandoning the "status quo" - tribes that are static die. 
Facilitate opportunities for your tribe to grow both collectively and individually in ways that stretch their current capacities. 
Play BIG and outside the box of convention to meet the needs of your tribe - some people may call you crazy, but wild success rarely comes by staying inside the box and following what others have done.

## Stimulate Affinity
Recognize shared affinities that tribe members have. 
These may be shared values, beliefs, common interests or goals. 
Play to them through discussions, groups, events. 
Create experiences that people can learn from and share.

## Use global messaging to announce, inform and engage
Send global email messages as promised and with permission! 
Consistently send weekly digest to announce, inform and engage, NOT to promote, sell or manage. 
When done well, members rarely opt for the delete like spam action.

          
## Create Barriers To Entry or Completely Eliminate Them
Decide the type of people you want to have in your tribe and either make it easy or hard to join. 
Buy a book, enter a contest, intern. 
Or make anyone able to join. 
It's up to you and you have to manage the tribe differently in each situation.

## Use the tribes' size and contacts to generate perks
The tribe isn't there to provide everything for tribe members, but any sizable or influential enough tribe can negotiate deals with businesses or groups for discounts or similar exchanges. 


## Never Confuse Effort With Results
A tribe wants to do something - meaning, that counts - and you need to make sure that they get there. 
No mission = no win and no win = no satisfaction. 
Everyone tries, leaders (& tribes) deliver results that matter.

## Absorb, Deflect, Scatter - the Heat
Act like sunscreen for your tribe. 
The leader keeps the harmful rays and heat off the tribe while the tribe does the important work. 
Keep Mr. No and Ms. Drain-the-energy from the tribe - take the heat and turn the negative ions into more energy to fuel the tribe.
        
## Don't assume everyone wants in
Just look for those who resonate with your mission
