# ðŸ‘´Director:Manager contract

## Basic expectations
- Align and ask for results
- Provide feedback based on your experience
- Make it clear you're not competing and not here to overrule decisions, but expect /soundness/ from manager's decisions
    - You're not right just because you're sitting on the problem.
- Delegate what you know best
- Check for status, not details. Drive for closure
