# Coaching for Growth

Coaching for Growth == levelling up individuals who may not _yet_ be up-to-par. Coaching for performance == levelling up already stellar individuals


## The basics
- Find person’s long term ambitions first (can't grow someone in a direction they don't want to)
- Steep vs Gradual growth phases - **focus on depth (gradual) or impact (steep)**
- Find out where person finds **meaning**, create an environment to help them w that
- Don’t offer solutions, offer *challenges*
- Junior devs/newcomers: ask as many clarifying questions as possible (don't know what I don't know)
